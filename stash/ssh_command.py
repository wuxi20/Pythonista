'''This script connects through SSH to the Computer/Server using the Username & Password defined in the header.
It then runs a command/script that is passed as an argument by long pressing the Run icon in Pythonista or by
calling the script through Pythonista's URL scheme with an argument.

General Notes:
- The keychain module is used to save the username's password so it's not out in the open.
- All sections in CAPS are meant to be revised according to each user's specific information.
