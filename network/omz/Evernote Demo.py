# A simple Evernote API demo script that lists all notebooks in the user's
# account and creates a simple test note in the default notebook.
#
# Before running this sample, you must fill in your Evernote developer token!
# 
# This sample is part of the Evernote SDK and has been modified slightly for
# Pythonista, to take advantage of the clipboard and PIL modules.
# If there is an image in the clipboard when the script is run, it is attached
# to the sample note.

# Real applications authenticate with Evernote using OAuth, but for the
# purpose of exploring the API, you can get a developer token that allows
# you to access your own Evernote account.

# To get a developer token, visit
# https://www.evernote.com/api/DeveloperToken.action

auth_token = "YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN"

# This assumes that this script is in the root folder, and the Evernote SDK
# is installed in the 'evernote-sdk' directory, using this installer script:
# https://gist.github.com/5048588
