# This script uses Evernote's API to create a new template note to be used in meetings. 
# The template includes the following fields: Date, Time, Attendance, Objective, Remarks and 
# Action Items. The fields are shown using Evernote Markup Language. It also automatically 
# adds the the date when the note was created at the end of the note's title.
#
# When run, it lists all notebooks in a user's account (just as reference), then 
# asks for the title of the new note (automatically adding the current date at the
# end in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD), then asks for the tags to be assigned to the note and 
# creates it in a pre-defined notebook (hard coded in the ntbkName variable below). 
# 
# It was made using the sample script by Pythonista's creator Ole Zorn as a baseline. I modified it
# to suit my needs.
#
# Please, keep in mind Before running this sample, you must fill in your Evernote developer token!
