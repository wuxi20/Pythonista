clipslate.py: capture page title and url and current 
iOS system clipboard and append to a notesy.app file 
in markdown format in order to collect a series of dated,
named and linked pieces of copied plain text for 
later processing
notsey.app x-callback-url implementation is documented at http://notesy-app.com/weblog/files/b7e15801e5b4448495eaaccfdb374cc7-20.htm
This script can be adapted for any other x-callback-url app with an append action

install this script to your pythonista.app top-level directory

Create the following bookmark in your browser app with the name
'cs' (or your choice):

    javascript:window.location='pythonista://clipslate?action=run&argv='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'&argv='+encodeURIComponent(location.href);

Then navigate to target page, highlight some text, copy it and tap the cs bookmark

Known bug: does not handle unicode characters

Known limitation: system clipboard copies plain text from browsers, not HTML, so copied embedded limks are lost
