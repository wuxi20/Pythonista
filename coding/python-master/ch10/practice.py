#Suppose you have a list of words and

                                #of each tuple (which is the 3 in the tuple (3, 'but')) -- it only considers the second

#Tuple assignment

#You can have a tuple on the left side of an assignment statement, allowing you to assign more than one variable
#at a time when the left side is a sequence. 

#Here is a two element list. 

m = ['have', 'fun']

#We assign the first and second elements to the variables x and y.

x, y = m

print(x)
print(y)

#Essentially x = m[0] and y = m[1]
#We can swap values in a single statement 

x, y = y, x 

print(x)
print(y)

#both sides of this statement are tuples, but the left side is a tuple of variables
#the right side is a tuple of expressions. Each value on the right side is assigned 
#to its respective variable on the left side.The expressions on the right are evaluated first. 
#Note, the number of variables on the right side must be the same on the left. 

#the right side can be any kind of sequesnce.

addr = 'monty@python.org'
uname, domain = addr.split('@') #the right side is a list with two elements, monty and python.org

print(uname)
print(domain)

#Dictionaries and Tuples

#Dictionaries have a method called items that returns a list of tuples, 
#where each tuple is a key value pair. The items are in no particular order.

d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}
t = list(d.items())

print(t)

#Since t is a list of tuples, and tuples are comparable, we can 
#sort the list of tuples. Converting a dictionary to a list of tuples
#is a way for us to output the contenet of a dictionary  sorted by key.

t.sort()

print(t)

#This new list is in ascending alphapetical order by the key value (letter a, b and c). 

#Multiple assignment with dictionaries

#You can traverse keys and values of a dictionary with a single loop
#using items, tuple assignment and for.

for key, val in list(d.items()):
    print(val, key)

#this loop has two iteration variables, key and val, because items returns a list of tuples
#Key and val successively iterate through each of the key value pairs in the dictionary. 
#note that the output is hash key orger (e.g. in no particular order.)

d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22} #here is a list of tuples, sorted by value and key.

l = list()

for key,val in list(d.items()): #items method gives us a list of key and value tuples. 
                          #For each key and value in our key, value list of tuples
                          #append the value and the key to our new list called l.
    l.append((val, key))

#using tuples as keys in dictionaries

#Remember: The in operator uses different algorithms for lists and dictionaries. 
#For lists, it uses a linear search algorithm. As the list gets londer, the search 
#time gets longer in direct proportion to the length of the list. For dictionaries, 
#python uses an algorithm called a hash table where the in operator takes the same 
#amount of time no matter how many items there are in a dictionary. 

#Imagine we need to create a telephone directory, that maps from last-name, first-name
#pairs to telephone numbers.

#the expression in the bracket is a tuple.

for last, first in directory:
    print(first, last, directory[last, first])

#this loop traverses the keys in the directory, which are tuples. 
#it assigns the elements of each tuple to last and first, then prints 
#the name and corresponding telephone number.
