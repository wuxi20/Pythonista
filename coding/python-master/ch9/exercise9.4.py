#Exercise 9.4 Add code to the exercise 9.3 program 
#to figure out who has the most messages in the file.
#After all the data has been read and the dictionary has been created, look through
#the dictionary using a maximum loop (see Section 5.7.2) to find who has the most
#messages and print how many messages the person has.
