#Initialize one or more variables before the loop starts 
#Performing some computation on each item in the loop body, possibly changing the variables in the body of the loop
#Looking at the resulting variables when the loop completes
#Assuming you've imported the necessary module and beautiful soup already, your first step is to initialize a few variables with the user's input.

#Now, the assignment says we need parse certain data on a webpage, then using the data we parsed, go to another webpage and parse data there too -- and so forth for a number of times. Based on that info, I figured a nested loop would be handy. 

#A simple option is to wrap all of your parsing code in a for statement with python's built-in function range(). 

When your loops are done, use a print( statement to see how your variables changed.)
