#power of regular expressions comes when we add special characters to the search string
#that allow us to more precisely control which lines match the string.
#Adding these special characters to our regular expression allow us to do sophisticated
#matching and extraction while writing very little code.

#character, followed by an at-sign, followed by at least one
