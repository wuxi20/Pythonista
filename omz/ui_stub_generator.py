# Stub generator for ui module
# NOTES:
# * For classes, the base class is always assumed to be `object`. This isn't correct, but it shouldn't matter much because the
# generated stubs also contain inherited methods and data descriptors. Using the actual base classes would complicate things a
# little because the class definitions would have to appear in the correct order then.
# * It's not possible to get correct argspecs for functions and methods that are implemented in C, so they're always just
# `self, *args` (for bound methods) or `*args*` (for module-level functions) in the output.
