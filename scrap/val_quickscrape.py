# This is a very basic scraper-spider for those html books where there's a table of contents page that links to a 
# bunch of sub-pages with actual content (like the documentation for a bunch of libraries).
#
# Dependencies: Beautiful soup 4 on Python 2.7.
# 
# It assumes all content is vanilla html or at least can be accessed through vanilla html.
#
# To use: run script from terminal (etc.), then pass the script a url to the table of contents (ToC)   
# page through the prompt you get. This script scrapes every unique page linked from ToC and 
# concatenates the contents of their html bodies into one big html page (which is technically 
# invalid as lacks html tag, doctype, etc., but every browser in the world forgives this so 
# really who cares?).
# 
# The point is to save those things for offline reading, for planes etc.  It targets pythonista 
# on iPad for optimum usefulness as offline reader, though should also work fine on real 
# computers, also on phones and such.

# This is identical to the functionality of earlier script @ https://gist.github.com/paultopia/460acfda07f9ca7314e5 
# EXCEPT: 
# 1. validates links to make sure they come from same domain as original page 
# 2. handles absolute links
# 3. handles links relative to root (eg starting with '/')

# Please only scrape content with copyright terms that permit copying.  Be nice to writers.  

# The primary intended use of this is to scrape documentation offered to the public under 
# licenses that permit copying, but which are often distributed in clueless formats (such as 
# the documentation for many open-source software packages, which is often provided under 
# Creative Commons or MIT licenses, permitting scraping).
